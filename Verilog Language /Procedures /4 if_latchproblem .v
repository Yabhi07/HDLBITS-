//When you write combinational logic in Verilog using always @(*) blocks,
//the synthesis tool expects every output signal to be assigned a value for every possible input condition. If some outputs are left unassigned in certain branches of your code, the tool assumes you want to remember the previous valueâ€”and it infers a level-sensitive latch to do so
